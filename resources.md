This site is built with GitHub Pages, which uses Jekyll. To develop, I suggest
you use Docker to run a local version of Jekyll and preview changes before
pushing them up to your website. To start your server, run: `docker-compose up`

The site stylesheet is built with Bootstrap, Bootswatch and Font Awesome.
